Recall that the overarching goal is to interconnect the access ISPs so that all end systems can send packets to each other. One naive approach would be to have each access ISP directly connect with every other access ISP. Such a mesh design is, of course, much too costly for the access ISPs, as it would require each access ISP to have a separate communication link to each of the hundreds of thousands of other access ISPs all over the world.

The passage discusses the challenge of interconnecting access Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to enable communication between all end systems (like computers, smartphones, and servers) across the globe. The overarching goal is to ensure that any end system connected to one access ISP can send packets (data) to any other end system connected to a different access ISP, regardless of their location.

### The Naive Approach: Full Mesh Design
The passage mentions a naive approach to achieving this goal: a **full mesh design**, where every access ISP is directly connected to every other access ISP. In this scenario:
- Each access ISP would need a dedicated communication link to every other access ISP in the world.
- For example, if there are 100,000 access ISPs globally, each ISP would need 99,999 separate links to connect to all the others.

### Problems with the Full Mesh Design
While this approach would technically achieve the goal of universal connectivity, it is highly impractical and inefficient for several reasons:
1. **Cost**:
   - Establishing and maintaining hundreds of thousands of physical links would be prohibitively expensive.
   - Each link requires infrastructure (e.g., fiber-optic cables, routers, and switches), which incurs significant capital and operational expenses.
   - Smaller access ISPs, in particular, would struggle to afford such a setup.

2. **Scalability**:
   - As the number of access ISPs grows, the number of required links increases exponentially. For \( N \) ISPs, the number of links needed is \( \frac{N(N-1)}{2} \).
   - This makes the system unscalable and unwieldy as the internet continues to expand.

3. **Complexity**:
   - Managing and maintaining such a vast number of direct connections would be extremely complex.
   - Each ISP would need to negotiate and manage agreements with every other ISP, leading to administrative overhead.

4. **Resource Utilization**:
   - Most of these dedicated links would remain underutilized most of the time, as not all ISPs need to communicate with each other simultaneously.
   - This inefficiency makes the full mesh design wasteful in terms of both physical and financial resources.

### A Better Solution: Tiered Network Architecture
Instead of a full mesh design, the internet uses a **tiered network architecture** with **transit ISPs** and **Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)** to achieve global connectivity more efficiently:
1. **Transit ISPs**:
   - These are larger ISPs that provide connectivity to smaller access ISPs.
   - Access ISPs pay transit ISPs to carry their traffic to other parts of the internet.
   - This eliminates the need for each access ISP to connect directly to every other access ISP.

2. **Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)**:
   - IXPs are physical locations where multiple ISPs can interconnect and exchange traffic.
   - By peering at IXPs, ISPs can reduce their reliance on transit ISPs and lower costs.

3. **Peering Agreements**:
   - ISPs can establish direct connections (peering) with each other to exchange traffic without going through a transit ISP.
   - This is often done when two ISPs have a significant amount of traffic to exchange.

### Benefits of the Tiered Approach
- **Cost Efficiency**: Access ISPs only need to connect to a few transit ISPs or IXPs, rather than every other access ISP.
- **Scalability**: The tiered structure allows the internet to grow without requiring exponential increases in infrastructure.
- **Flexibility**: ISPs can choose the most cost-effective and efficient ways to connect based on their needs.
- **Redundancy**: Multiple paths between ISPs improve reliability and fault tolerance.

In summary, while a full mesh design is theoretically possible, it is impractical due to its high cost, inefficiency, and complexity. The internet instead relies on a tiered architecture with transit ISPs, IXPs, and peering agreements to achieve global connectivity in a scalable and cost-effective manner.

# Types of Data Transmission

```
Explain like I'm five what is meant by types of data transmission in this context.
```

Okay, imagine you have a big pipe (like a hose) that can carry water. But instead of water, this pipe carries **information** like your voice when you talk on the phone, or pictures and videos when you watch something on the internet.

Now, this pipe is super smart! It can carry **three different kinds of information at the same time** by using different "lanes" inside the pipe. Here’s how it works:

1. **Voice Lane**: This is for your phone calls. When you talk to Grandma, your voice goes through this lane.
2. **Sending Lane**: This is for when you send something, like a picture or an email, to someone else.
3. **Receiving Lane**: This is for when you get something, like a video or a game, from the internet.

The pipe uses different "magic colors" (frequencies) to keep these lanes separate so they don’t mix up. That way, you can talk to Grandma, send a picture to your friend, and watch a video all at the same time without any problems!

So, **types of data transmission** just means the different kinds of information (voice, sending, receiving) that the pipe can carry at the same time using its magic colors.

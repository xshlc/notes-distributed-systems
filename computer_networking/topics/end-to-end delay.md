How can we compute the end-to-end delay for P packets over N links? How can we compute the number of routers?

To compute the end-to-end delay for  P  packets over  N  links and determine the number of routers, we need to consider several factors, including transmission delay, propagation delay, and the number of routers.

### 1. **End-to-End Delay Calculation**

The end-to-end delay ( D_{\text{total}} ) for  P  packets over  N  links can be calculated as follows:

$$
D_{\text{total}} = P \times (D_{\text{trans}} + D_{\text{prop}} + D_{\text{queue}} + D_{\text{proc}})
$$

Where:
-  $D_{{trans}}$  is the **transmission delay** (time to push all bits of a packet onto the link).
-  $D_{\text{prop}}$  is the **propagation delay** (time for a bit to travel from one end of the link to the other).
-  $D_{\text{queue}}$  is the **queuing delay** (time a packet spends waiting in router buffers).
-  $D_{\text{proc}}$  is the **processing delay** (time a router takes to process a packet).

#### Transmission Delay $D_{\text{trans}}$:
$$
D_{\text{trans}} = \frac{L}{R}
$$
-  L  = packet size (in bits)
-  R  = transmission rate of the link (in bits per second)

#### Propagation Delay $D_{\text{prop}}$:
$$
D_{\text{prop}} = \frac{d}{s}
$$
-  d  = distance of the link (in meters)
-  s  = propagation speed (typically  2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}  in fiber or copper)

#### Queuing and Processing Delays:
- These are often negligible or can be estimated based on network conditions.

#### Total Delay for  P  Packets:
For  P  packets, the total delay is:
$$
D_{\text{total}} = P \times (D_{\text{trans}} + D_{\text{prop}} + D_{\text{queue}} + D_{\text{proc}})
$$

If the packets are sent back-to-back, the first packet experiences the full delay, and subsequent packets experience overlapping delays. In this case, the total delay can be approximated as:
$$
D_{\text{total}} = (P - 1) \times D_{\text{trans}} + N \times (D_{\text{trans}} + D_{\text{prop}})
$$

### 2. **Number of Routers**

The number of routers ( R ) in a path with  N  links is:
$$
R = N - 1
$$
- Each link connects two routers (or a router and an end host), so the number of routers is one less than the number of links.

### Example Calculation

Assume:
-  P = 10  packets
-  N = 5  links
-  L = 1500  bits
-  R = 1 $\text{Mbps} = 10^6 \, \text{bits/s}$ 
-  d = $1000 \text{km} = 10^6 \, \text{m}$
-  s = $2 \times 10^8 \text{m/s}$ 
- Neglect queuing and processing delays.

#### Transmission Delay:
$$
D_{\text{trans}} = \frac{1500}{10^6} = 1.5 \, \text{ms}
$$

#### Propagation Delay:
$$
D_{\text{prop}} = \frac{10^6}{2 \times 10^8} = 5 \, \text{ms}
$$

#### Total Delay:
$$
D_{\text{total}} = (10 - 1) \times 1.5 + 5 \times (1.5 + 5) = 13.5 + 32.5 = 46 \, \text{ms}
$$

#### Number of Routers:
$$
R = 5 - 1 = 4
$$

Thus, the end-to-end delay is **46 ms**, and there are **4 routers** in the path.

To determine the **end-to-end delay** for $P$ packets sent over a series of $N$ links, we can generalize the scenario described in your explanation. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

---

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Store-and-Forward Routers**: Each router must receive, store, and process the entire packet before forwarding it to the next link.
2. **No Propagation Delay**: The time for a bit to travel across a link is negligible.
3. **No Queuing or Processing Delays**: These delays are ignored for simplicity.
4. **Links Have the Same Rate $R$**: Each link transmits at the same rate $R$.

---

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Packet**:
   - The source begins transmitting the first packet at time $0$.
   - At time $\frac{L}{R}$, the first packet is fully transmitted to the first router.
   - At time $\frac{L}{R}$, the first router begins transmitting the first packet to the second router.
   - At time $2\frac{L}{R}$, the first packet is fully received by the destination.

2. **Second Packet**:
   - The source begins transmitting the second packet at time $\frac{L}{R}$ (immediately after finishing the first packet).
   - At time $2\frac{L}{R}$, the second packet is fully transmitted to the first router.
   - At time $2\frac{L}{R}$, the first router begins transmitting the second packet to the second router.
   - At time $3\frac{L}{R}$, the second packet is fully received by the destination.

3. **Third Packet**:
   - The source begins transmitting the third packet at time $2\frac{L}{R}$.
   - At time $3\frac{L}{R}$, the third packet is fully transmitted to the first router.
   - At time $3\frac{L}{R}$, the first router begins transmitting the third packet to the second router.
   - At time $4\frac{L}{R}$, the third packet is fully received by the destination.

### General Formula:
From the above pattern, we can generalize the **end-to-end delay** for $P$ packets over $N$ links as:

$$
d_{\text{end-to-end}} = (P + N - 1) \times \frac{L}{R}
$$

Where:
- $P$ = Number of packets
- $N$ = Number of links
- $L$ = Packet size (in bits)
- $R$ = Transmission rate of each link (in bits per second)

---

### Explanation of the Formula:
1. **First Packet**:
   - The first packet takes $N \times \frac{L}{R}$ time to reach the destination, as it must traverse $N$ links.

2. **Subsequent Packets**:
   - Each additional packet adds $\frac{L}{R}$ to the total delay because packets are pipelined. While the first packet is being forwarded by the routers, the source is already transmitting the next packet.

3. **Total Delay**:
   - The total delay is the sum of the time for the first packet to traverse all $N$ links ($N \times \frac{L}{R}$) and the time for the remaining $P - 1$ packets to be transmitted ($(P - 1) \times \frac{L}{R}$).

---

### Example:
Letâ€™s calculate the delay for $P = 3$ packets, $N = 2$ links, $L = 1500$ bits, and $R = 1 \, \text{Mbps} = 10^6 \, \text{bits/s}$.

1. Transmission delay per packet:
   $$
   \frac{L}{R} = \frac{1500}{10^6} = 1.5 \, \text{ms}
   $$

2. Total delay:
   $$
   d_{\text{end-to-end}} = (3 + 2 - 1) \times 1.5 = 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \, \text{ms}
   $$

Thus, the destination will receive all 3 packets after **6 ms**.

---

### Key Takeaways:
- The formula $d_{\text{end-to-end}} = (P + N - 1) \times \frac{L}{R}$ accounts for the pipelining effect of sending multiple packets over multiple links.
- The delay increases linearly with the number of packets ($P$) and the number of links ($N$).

## What is a packet-switched network?

A packet-switched network is a type of digital communications network that groups all transmitted data into suitably sized blocks, called packets, which are then transmitted individually through the network. This method contrasts with circuit-switched networks, where a dedicated communication path is established between two parties for the duration of the communication session.

### Key Characteristics of Packet-Switched Networks:
1. **Data Segmentation**: Data is broken down into small, manageable packets.
2. **Header Information**: Each packet contains a header with control information, such as source and destination addresses, sequence numbers, and error-checking codes.
3. **Dynamic Routing**: Packets can take different paths to reach the destination, depending on network conditions and congestion.
4. **Efficiency**: Resources are used more efficiently since multiple communications can share the same network links.
5. **Error Handling**: Packets can be retransmitted if they are lost or corrupted during transmission.

### How It Works:
1. **Packetization**: The sending device breaks the data into packets.
2. **Transmission**: Each packet is sent independently through the network.
3. **Routing**: Network devices (like routers) determine the best path for each packet.
4. **Reassembly**: The receiving device reassembles the packets into the original data.

### Advantages:
- **Resource Sharing**: Multiple users can share the same network resources simultaneously.
- **Scalability**: Easier to scale and expand compared to circuit-switched networks.
- **Robustness**: More resilient to failures, as packets can be rerouted if a path becomes unavailable.

### Disadvantages:
- **Latency**: Variable latency due to different paths and potential congestion.
- **Complexity**: More complex to manage and implement compared to circuit-switched networks.
- **Overhead**: Additional overhead due to packet headers and routing information.

### Examples:
- **Internet**: The most well-known example of a packet-switched network.
- **Local Area Networks (LANs)**: Many LANs use packet-switching technologies like Ethernet.
- **Wireless Networks**: Mobile data networks (e.g., 4G, 5G) also use packet switching.

Packet-switched networks are fundamental to modern digital communications, enabling the efficient and flexible transmission of data across diverse and complex networks.
